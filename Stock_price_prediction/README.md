The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the next 10 days of Apple Inc.â€™s stock prices. Given the complexity of stock market data, which can exhibit both short-term sequential dependencies and broader trends.  
Therefore, we will apply a hybrid modelling approach combining LSTM (to capture time dependencies and short-term trends) and Linear Regression (to capture long-term trends).
